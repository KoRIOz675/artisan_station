# AppWebsite

Welcome to the website of the G7C APP group.

Recall of the project:

## Topic 4: Sales and promotion platform for artisans and creators

The goal of the project is to develop a website allowing artisans and independent creators (jewelers, ceramicists, woodworkers, etc.) to showcase and sell their creations.
Each artisan can list their products for sale or through a custom order system, providing details about each piece (materials used, dimensions, price, production time, etc.).
The site would also include a section to promote events such as craft fairs, workshops, or exhibitions.
Finally, a virtual gallery could be integrated to allow visitors to explore the artisans' collections in an immersive environment.
